## About Pilotexc

Pilotexc is a prototype application produced as part of my ultimate OpenClassrooms 'Web Developer' training project.

- Import its accounting entries for each accounting year
- Manage users of the application for its structure

## My stack

The backend is created in PHP with Laravel 7.
All views returned by laravel are empty and all data is provided by an API.

On the frontend, the template is Laravel-AdminLTE by @jeroennoten (https://github.com/JeroenNoten/Laravel-AdminLTE#611-menu)
I use only jQuery and Ajax request for consuming API.

Javascript and Sass resources are compiled by Webpack.
